# Touristine

Searching for places to visit through conventional methods can be a draining endeavor. The issue mainly resides in the struggles usually encountered by sight seekers that comprise difficulties in locating current information about their chosen destination, essential services, recent imagery, and the quest to find places that align with their specific criteria and requirements. The process of traditional search often falls short, providing insufficient and contradictory data from various sources. This occurs because resources tend to suggest destinations generically, overlooking diverse interests and needs.

Touristine serves as a comprehensive travel companion, enabling users to explore Palestine's diverse and historically rich landscapes. It overcomes the previously mentioned issues by providing users with destination information, services, and locations, all tailored to their preferences, streamlining the process and saving time. Users can quickly access a wealth of information, share feedback, and view others' experiences to make decisions. Touristine also offers personalized plans for those struggling to choose destinations, taking various factors into account. Users can upload pictures of places they have visited so others can view a recent exhibit of the destination. Simultaneously, pictures taken for historical monuments will undergo a crack analysis test, to identify potential hazards. For inquiries, users can contact admins in charge of that particular area. Touristine bridges the gap between exploration, cultural appreciation, and responsible tourism.
